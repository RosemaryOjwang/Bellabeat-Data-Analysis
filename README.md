## To Do
1. Identify the fitness activities that are most commonly tracked in the non-Bellabeat data:
       - Are users mostly tracking steps, workouts, or sleep?
       - Do users track calories burned, active minutes, or heart rate?
2. How frequently do users log their activity data? Understanding this can help assess user retention and engagement over time.
